Project 0: CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is a project that recreates the front end pages for Google Search, Google Images, and four of the features of Google Advanced Search.  I attempted to recreate Google's CSS best I could using bootstrap and CSS styling.  

The Google Advanced Search fields required by the project were:
    Find pages with:
        "all these words:"
        "this exact word or phrase:"
        "any of these words:"
        "none of these words:"

The main page, "Google Search" is named "index.html".  "Google Images" is named "images.html" and lastly, "Google Advanced Search" is named "advanced.html".  All three pages have links to the other pages in the upper right hand corner.  The Google Search page includes an "I'm Feeling Lucky" button, in which you do encounter a redirect notice, but that was something we were warned would happen in the project instructions.
